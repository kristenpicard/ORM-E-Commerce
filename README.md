# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

This project is the back end for an e-commerce site. I updated starter code to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Functionality:

- View all Categories using GET
- View all Products using GET
- View all Tags using GET

- Create new Categories using POST
- Create new Products using POST
- Create new Tags using POST

- Update existing Categories using PUT
- Update existing Products using PUT
- Update existing Tags using PUT

- Remove existing Categories using DELETE
- Remove existing Products using DELETE
- Remove existing Tags using DELETE

## Installation

Clone the repository at https://github.com/kristenpicard/ORM-E-Commerce and load it on code editor of your choice. Vscode is the prefered editor.

In the command line, the user can invoke the application with "npm start". Because this project is only the back end of the application, the user will need to use the command line to create the database and seed it. Additionally to test the various API routes, a tool such as Insomnia is needed to view the functionality.
